## Finding LCA of two nodes a,b

Finding LCA becomes simpler compared to Binary Trees.

We iteratively traverse from root to left or right for both a & b, like we do for searching them.

If our **search is split into two different directions**, i.e. left for a and right for b,
Then we are at a lowest common ancestor.
