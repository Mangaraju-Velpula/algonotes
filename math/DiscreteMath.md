a total or linear order is a partial order in which any two elements are comparable. That is, a total order is a binary relation ${\displaystyle \leq }\leq$  on some set ${\displaystyle X}X$, which satisfies the following for all ${\displaystyle a,b}a,b and {\displaystyle c}c in {\displaystyle X}X$:

${\displaystyle a\leq a}{\displaystyle a\leq a} (reflexive)$.
If ${\displaystyle a\leq b}a\leq b$ and ${\displaystyle b\leq c}{\displaystyle b\leq c}$ then ${\displaystyle a\leq c}{\displaystyle a\leq c}$ (transitive).
If {\displaystyle a\leq b}a\leq b and {\displaystyle b\leq a}{\displaystyle b\leq a} then {\displaystyle a=b}a=b (antisymmetric).
{\displaystyle a\leq b}a\leq b or {\displaystyle b\leq a}{\displaystyle b\leq a} (strongly connected, formerly called total).
