## Total Order

a total or linear order is a partial order in which any two elements are comparable. That is, a total order is a binary relation $\leq$  on some set $X$, which satisfies the following for all $a,b and c in X$:

* $a \leq a$ (reflexive).
* If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$ then $a\leq c$ (transitive).
* If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq a$ then $a = b$ (antisymmetric).
* $a \leq b$ or $b \leq a$ (strongly connected, formerly called total).


## Partial Order

A partial order relation is a homogeneous relation that is transitive and antisymmetric.

### Strict (reflexive) partial order

A reflexive, weak, or non-strict partial order is a homogeneous relation â‰¤ on a set P that is `reflexive`, `antisymmetric`, and `transitive`.

1. Reflexivity: $a \leq a$
2. AntiSymmetric: If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq a$ then $a = b$
3. Transitive: If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$ then $a \leq c$


### Non-strict partial order

An irreflexive, strong,or strict partial order is a homogeneous relation < on a set P that is `irreflexive`, `asymmetric`, and `transitive`

1. Irreflexivity : a is not related to itself
2. AntiSymmetric: If $a \le b$ then $b \nless a$
3. Transitive: If $a \le b$ and $b \le c$ then $a \le c$
