It is a total-order on set of integers

### Common inqualities

1. For any real number a, a^2 >= 0

2. `Trichotomy law`: Exactly one of the following can hold
   1. a > b
   2. a = b
   3. a < b

3. `Transitive`: If `a < b` and `b < c` then `a < c`

4. `Preservation of inequality by addition`
```
if a < b then:
a + c < b + c
```

5. `Preservation of inequality by positive multiplication`:
```
if a < b and c > 0 then:
ac < bc and (a/c) < (b/c)
```

6. `Reversal of inequality by negative multiplication`
```
if a < b and c < 0 then:
ac > bc and (a/c) > (b/c)
```
