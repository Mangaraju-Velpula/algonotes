### Division algorithm

Simultaneously defines quotient and remainder.

For any m,n in natural numbers,
`m = q.n + r`
`m = q.n + m mod n`
`m = floor(m/n).n + m mod n`

Here quotent q = floor(m/n)
and remainder r = m mod n

### Divides relation

Forms a partial order over integers.

Notation for a divides b is `a | b`.
if `a divides b` then `b mod a = 0` 

### GCD definition

Also known as largest common factor.

Let a,b be non-zero integers.
GCD is unique natural number d such that,
1. `d | a` and `d | b`.
2. If there is a `c | a` and `c | b` , then `c | d` - a smaller common factor `c` between a and b
