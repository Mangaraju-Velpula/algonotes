### Absolute definition

It is defined as follows:
```
f(x) = |x| =
    = x, if x >= 0,
    = -x, if x < 0
```

### Properties

1. Absolute is always greater than or equal to 0
```
|x| >= 0
```

2. square of absolute is same as square of number
```
x ^ 2 = | x ^ 2 |
```

3. original is always less than it's absolute
```
x <= |x|
```

4. Absolute value of a product is same as product of individual absolute values
```
|x.y| = |x|.|y| 
```
From following 3 above, `x.y <= |x.y|` and `x.y <= |x|.|y|`

5. Absolute value of a sum is less than or equal to sum of absolutes
```
|x + y| <= |x| + |y|
```

6. Absolute value of a substraction is always greater than or equal to substraction of absolutes
```
|x - y| >= |x| - |y|
```
