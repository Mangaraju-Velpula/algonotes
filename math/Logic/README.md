## Proposition vs predicate

A **proposition** is a statement that is having a truth value(either true or false) associated with it. 

Where a **predicate** is a statement whose truth value is dependent upon the **variables** and/or **quantification**. 

Predicate Example: `𝑃(𝑛):𝑛` is an odd integer. Where a domain is a set of all integers. Here, `𝑃(𝑛)` is dependent upon `𝑛`.

Example `3+3=6` is a proposition.
