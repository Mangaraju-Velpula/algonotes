window size can vary continuously as we keep processing arr elements

### approach 1: both start and end pointers start from 0

### Main outer loop

endIndex goes from `0` to `n-1`

i.e.
`for endIdx in range(len(arr))`


### startIdx increment condition

This usually depends on the type of the problem, 
which decides when do we want to shrink the window.
