### sorting of strings

`ab` appears lexicographically before `abc`.


### Preprocessing

Preprocessing pattern or text has become a common idea across many algorithms
to generate lookup tables to assist with the algorithms

### ONline vs offline algorithm

Algorithm that `pre-process Text T` is called offline algorithm otherwise it is online algorithm.

### Indexing text

Indexing text is common preprocessing text technique used by databases and search engine

## k-mer

A substring of length `k` is known as a `k-mer`.

How many `k-mer`s are there in a string of length n?
Ans: `n-k+1` k-mers in a string

## Factor of string

Factor is another word for substring

## Border of string

A `border` of a non-empty string s is proper substring of s, that is both prefix and suffix of s.

Thus $\phi$, `a`, `aa`, `aabaa` are all borders of `aabaabaa`.
The border of a border of given string `s` is also a border of `s`.


`Border(x)` = longest border of x.
