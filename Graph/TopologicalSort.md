A linear ordering of vertices in a DAG so that vertex u comes before vertexv, if directed edge `u -> v` exists in the DAG.

## Requirement: Directed graph

## DFS based

## Kahn's algorithm

## Variant 1: Count number of different topological orderings

## Variant 2: list all different topological orderings
