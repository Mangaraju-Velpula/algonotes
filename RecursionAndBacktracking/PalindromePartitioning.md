## Partition s, such that every substring is a palindrome

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= s.length <= 16
s contains only lowercase English letters.
```

## Only way is brute force

## Try all possible partitions and check if al partitioned strings are palindrome
