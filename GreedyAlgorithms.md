## Optimal substructure

Optimal solution to problems incorporates optimal solutions to subproblems

## Greedy choice property

locally optimal choices lead to a globally optimal solution.

## Cut and paste argument

Suppose you have some optimal solution,
and it does not have  a property you want,
you modify it by cutting out one part of solution and pasting in a different part, you still have an optimal solution.

Another way to think of this is:
The greedy choice always improves the solution or keeps it same, never harms the solution.

## Exchange argument
